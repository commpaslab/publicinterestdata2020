## Week 5 Assignment

I think we need one more week exploring the data before breaking up into teams to produce, so this week is about getting more familiar with the Albemarle County data, beyond what you were able to learn last week by focusing on a particular data set.

### Proposing research questions

Identify three specific research questions we can address with the Albemarle County data **that you would be interested in developing further in this lab.** These can build from questions and analysis you've seen from the past reports that should be answered for Albemarle as well or could highlight new questions you thought were missing from the past work. Send these to me via direct message in slack.

### Getting familiar with the data

Generate a well-commented script that 

* loads needed libraries and reads in each of the data sets, 
* renames the variables based on the data dictionaries we began last week, and 
* formats the variables as necessary (for referrals, the only change was creating factors; you should review each data dictionary to see if there are any other incongruencies between the current type and the needed type).

Do you have additional questions about the data not already captured in the data dictionaries (or suggestions/revisions to the data dictionaries)? Definitely note these in comments in the script! The goal here is to take some time to develop a firmer sense of what information we have available. Then

1. Try to minimally replicate a figure from one of the prior reports addressing a question that can also be answered with the Albemarle County data. Don't worry about the niceties -- titles, labels, additional info provided on a figure -- just see if you can make something similar. Be sure to add in the commments what figure you're building from (e.g., Report name and Figure #). This may require you to do some recoding of variables first, or some filtering of observations!
2. Now try another approach to visualizing *the same information* -- how else might this be conveyed?
3. Take a first cut at answering one (or a part of one) of the questions you proposed as a research question (above) -- as an exploratory analysis. I'm imagining a straightforward comparison (difference in frequencies or in means, possibly conditional on something else; not a full model yet, as there's lots of data cleaning and prep we'll need to do first). This doesn't need to be inferential (e.g., connected to a chi-square test or t-test, etc.) yet -- we're still focused on description in this early stage. Be sure to explain the question you're addressing in comments.

### What to submit
The data viz/dates exploration R script should be sent to me via direct message in Slack by noon Friday, 10/23.
