The Public Interest Data Lab is intended to provide data science experience to students in service of the public interest. We have three goals:

* Make progress on a project that advances the public interest or social justice in collaboration with a community partner. And have a project you can point to at the end, an example of your work.
* Practice working with real data to answer real questions with attention to the moral and ethical implications of our work. This includes finding data, exploring and cleaning data, analyzing and modeling data, and visualizing and communicating data and doing so with care and humility and respect for the affected partners and communities.
* Develop experience working on a data science team, including processes for working collaboratively, openly, inclusively, and reproducibly.
 
## Fall 2020 Project
Our Fall 2020 partner is the Albemarle County Department of Social Services (ADSS) who wish to understand whether there is racial, ethnic, or other disproportionalities and disparate outcomes in local child welfare services, and if so, to what extent and at what stages.
