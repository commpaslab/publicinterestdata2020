## Schedule

There are no books to purchase for this class. All readings are either freely available or will be shared on perusall or slack. For each week, you should complete the assigned reading and material before coming to class. For the reading, you should highlight particular sections of interest for discussion in our collaborative annotations along with your thoughts; these will frame our discussion. There are three types of material: (1) research about the child welfare system and racial disparity, (2) scholarship on data and methods, primarily with a focus on using data responsibly and ethically, and (3) resources on using R.
