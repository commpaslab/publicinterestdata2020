## Week 2 Assignment

### Part 1

Read the [2019 Charlottesville Foster Care study](https://www.charlottesville.org/home/showdocument?id=67328) completed by the second year of the Public Interest Data Lab class. As you read, think about the following questions: 

* Reflect back on your questions after reading the first report - what research questions still stand out to you after reading the second report? Are there any new questions that come to mind in reading the second report?
* What areas of research are most interesting to you to work on for the remainder of the semester? We can't guarantee everyone will get their preferences, but it's useful for us to know your interests. 


### Part 2 

Open the [week2-example.R file](https://github.com/datafordemocracy/public-interest-data-2020/blob/master/example-files/week2-example.R) and the [bestpractices.R](https://github.com/datafordemocracy/public-interest-data-2020/blob/master/example-files/bestpractices.R) file in R Studio. Mount the data in Veracrypt and read in the data. 

You'll use the same variables as before, [variable assignments here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pOKLV4lXYs4Dyx3Gft959NhwY0FjkmN94rbZLMsI7Zc/edit?usp=sharing). Again feel free to collaborate with other students in the course!

*Challenge:* If you are already an R allstar, pick a finding from the 2019 report and try to replicate the table/graph/model with the 2020 data. Code from the 2019 report is available on the course Github in the 2019 repo. 

### What to submit: 

* A short writeup (bulleted list, paragraph, etc.) of more detailed research questions and your specific areas of interest
* An R script with your exploratory analysis code with your assigned variables - come prepared to chat about what you found!

Send these to the *assignments* channel on Slack by noon on Monday, March 2nd.
