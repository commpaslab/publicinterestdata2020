# Practices for Sharing Client Data

To insure the security of [moderately sensitive client data](http://security.virginia.edu/university-data-protection-standards), lab members agree to the following practices and terms.

1. The data will be available for a brief time during class on a shared UVA Box folder, [approved for moderately sensitive data](http://its.virginia.edu/box/responsibilities.html). Lab members will download the file and save it in an encrypted volume. 
2. Lab members will only keep the data file in an encrypted volume with password protection on their computers.
  * A common option for Mac, PC, or Linux is the free, open-source encryption software [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html). Here are instructions for [installing and using VeraCrypt on a PC](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/veracrypt/windows/); here's another set of [instructions for PC](https://www.howtogeek.com/108501/the-how-to-geek-guide-to-getting-started-with-truecrypt/). Here are [instructions for a Mac](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/veracrypt/mac/); for use on a Mac, you must also install [OSXFUSE, FUSE for MacOS](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/40156/fuse-for-macos). 
  * Create a standard volume; this is where we'll store the data.
  * You'll view or call the data from, or save to, the protected folder only. You will need to mount the folder/volume each time you want to use the data, and dismount the folder/volume when you're done working.
3. Lab members will not place copies of the data file in any other location, including on portable storage devices or public machines.
4. Lab members will not print the data file.
5. When working with the data in non-private spaces, lab members will not leave their computers unattended. 
6. Lab members will not show or share the data file with colleagues outside the lab. If seeking help with code or analysis from those outside the lab, do not display the data frame in the data viewer.
7. At the conclusion of the semester project, when we have submitted the report, lab members will delete the data from their computers entirely.

Relatedly, while we will share code and the reasons and choices that go into generating the analysis, we will communicate the *results* of our work to our partners/client. They are responsible for disseminating and communicating the results outward.
